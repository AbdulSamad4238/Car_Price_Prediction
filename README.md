# Car_Price_Prediction
"Developed an end-to-end regression pipeline to predict used car prices using Python and scikit-learn. Cleaned messy real-world data (missing values, categorical encoding, typecasting), engineered features (car age, brand), and built visualizations to explain trends. Achieved R² score of ~0.7 with Linear Regression."
